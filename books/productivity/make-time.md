# Make Time

## Introduction

- We spend most of our time "by default".
  - Our device's default settings can drive our behavior as well.
- We are torn between "Busy Bandwagons" (culture of busyness) and "Infinity Pools" (endless social media content).
- The authors wanted to "design time".
- They designed a "design sprint", a redesigned workweek.
  - For five days, a team cancels all meetings and focuses on solving a single problem:
    - Monday: Team maps the problem.
    - Tuesday: Each person sketches a solution.
    - Wednesday: Decide on the best solutions.
    - Thursday: Build a prototype.
    - Friday: Test the prototype.
- From this process, they learned lessons that they would apply to the "Make Time" philosophy:
  1. Something magic happens when you start the day with one high-priority goal.
  2. More things get done when you ban devices.
  3. Energy is important for focused work and clear thinking.
  4. Experimenting allows processes to be improved.

## How Make Time Works

- It's composed of four steps:
  - Highlight: Choose a single activity to prioritize and protect your calendar
  - Laser: Adjust your technology so you can find "laser mode" to focus
    - Energize: Use your body to recharge your brain throughout the day
  - Reflect: Take notes before going to bed
- We will be picking, testing, and repeating dozens of tactics to put this into practice.
- No need to be perfect.
- Adopt an "everyday" mindset.
- Make Time is not to increase productivity. It is to increase time spent on things you prioritize.

## Highlight

- Busy Bandwagons are bad. They lead to time feeling like a dizzy blur.
- We want to slow down and focus.
  - Tasks are too machine like.
  - Goals are too far away.
  - Highlights are just right.
- _What do I want to be the highlight of my day?_
  - Three criteria to pick, based on:
    1. Urgency
    2. Satisfaction
    3. Joy
- A good highlight takes 60 to 90 minutes.
